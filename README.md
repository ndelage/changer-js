# Changer - A JS Coin Changer

This project is incomplete. The goal is to calculate the smallest number of change pieces (pennies, nickels, dimes & quarters) needed for the specified number of cents.

## Phase 1
Complete 'src/changer.js' so that it supports all cents amounts. While doing so, add Jasmine tests to `spec/changer_spec.js`

Note: You can run the tests by opening the `SpecRunner.html` in your browser.

## Phase 2
Wire up `changer.html` so that entering a cents amount in input box causes the change piece counts to updated. You'll likely need to make some markup changes.
